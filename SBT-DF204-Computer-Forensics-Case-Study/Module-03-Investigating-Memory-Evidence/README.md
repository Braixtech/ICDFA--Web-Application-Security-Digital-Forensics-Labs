## 📌 Executive Summary

This case study examines a Windows 7 x86 (32-bit PAE) raw physical memory image (`memdumpWin7.mem`, **1,073,676,288 bytes**) acquired from a workstation after a confidential document may have been transferred without authorisation. Using Volatility 2.6.1 with the `Win7SP1x86_23418` profile in the ICDFA Kali lab environment, the investigation reconstructs a defensible sequence of user accounts, processes, network endpoints, command history, removable-media records, and File Explorer traces.

**Primary finding:** The memory image preserves a complete, corroborated **file-transfer sequence on 6 January 2019**. On the workstation `IE8WIN7`, the active user profile **`IEUser`** (SID `S-1-5-21-1716914095-909560446-1177810406-1000`) first accessed `C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads` at **14:49:40 UTC**; a generic USB mass-storage device (`Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00`, instance `661bec0f48605_60`) was enumerated at **15:02:54 UTC** and mounted as drive **F:** at **15:03:06 UTC**; the `Downloads` folder was revisited at **15:04:40 UTC**; and at **15:06:11 UTC** a `cmd.exe` process (PID **3996**) executed `ipconfig` → `cd Downloads` → `copy secret_file.docx F:`. The `consoles` plugin recovered the console screen buffer, which shows the copy operation **completed successfully** — the shell printed **`1 file(s) copied.`** The session was captured shortly afterwards while `FTK Imager.exe` (PID 2596) was running.

**Secondary observations:** A second local profile **`sshd_server`** (SID ending `-1002`) exists with its NTUSER.DAT hive loaded, and an `sshd.exe` process (PID 2016) was listening on TCP port 22. Two TCP connections to `192.168.56.5:80` from local ports 49177 and 49178 were recorded in CLOSED state.

**Confidence Level:** **High (≈ 90%)** for the recorded sequence and for the completion of the copy operation, based on cross-plugin consistency. **Moderate (≈ 60-70%)** for personal attribution — the memory image records workstation-profile activity, not the physical identity of the person at the keyboard.

**Authorisation statement:** All analysis was completed offline using the supplied training image. No remote host, IP, account, or service named in the evidence was contacted. No recovered file was executed, and no password or hash-cracking steps were performed. Unrelated personal data has been redacted.

## 1. Executive Conclusion

The memory image supplied for this case study contains a coherent, artifact-based sequence on **6 January 2019** that establishes the following. On the workstation `IE8WIN7`, the user profile `IEUser` first accessed `C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads` at **14:49:40 UTC**. A generic USB mass-storage device was enumerated at **15:02:54 UTC** and mounted as drive **F:** at **15:03:06 UTC**. The `Downloads` folder was revisited at **15:04:40 UTC** — between the USB mount and the subsequent command. At **15:06:11 UTC**, a `cmd.exe` process (PID 3996), spawned from `explorer.exe` (PID 2524) and hosted by `conhost.exe` (PID 3988), executed `ipconfig`, `cd Downloads`, and `copy secret_file.docx F:`. The console screen buffer preserved in memory shows the shell printed **`1 file(s) copied.`**, indicating that the copy operation completed successfully.

The image directly records:

- **Active user profile:** `IEUser`, SID `S-1-5-21-1716914095-909560446-1177810406-1000`, NTUSER.DAT loaded from `C:\Users\IEUser\ntuser.dat` at physical address `0x120049b0`.
- **Second user profile:** `sshd_server`, SID ending `-1002`, with its NTUSER.DAT loaded at `0x17ad09c8` — an SSH server service account, with `sshd.exe` (PID 2016) listening on TCP port 22.
- **Command history** captured from `conhost.exe` PID **3988**, containing the sequence `ipconfig`, `cd Downloads`, `copy secret_file.docx F:`.
- **Console screen output** showing the shell's response **`1 file(s) copied.`**
- **Removable USB device** (`Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00`, instance `661bec0f48605_60`) enumerated at **15:02:54 UTC**, referenced in the disk-device-interface class `{53f56307-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}`, and mapped to the DOS drive letter **F:**.
- **File Explorer evidence:** the `Downloads` folder was first accessed at **14:49:40 UTC** and the parent BagMRU key was updated at **15:04:40 UTC**.
- **Closed network connections** to `192.168.56.5:80` from local ports 49177 and 49178.

**Confidence Level:** **High (≈ 90%)** for the recorded artifact sequence and the completion of the copy operation. **Moderate (≈ 60-70%)** for personal attribution.

### Question 3: What user and account artefacts are relevant?

**Answer:**

**3.1 Active user profile — `printkey "Volatile Environment"`**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -K "Volatile Environment"
```

REG_SZ        LOCALAPPDATA    : (V) C:\Users\IEUser\AppData\Local
```

**Observation:** The `Volatile Environment` key is loaded from `C:\Users\IEUser\ntuser.dat` (the NTUSER.DAT hive of the currently logged-in profile), resolving to `HKEY_USERS\<SID>` linked by `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`. The active account is **`IEUser`** on workstation **`IE8WIN7`**, with profile path **`C:\Users\IEUser`**.

**3.3 Who is SID `…-1002`?**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -K "Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\S-1-5-21-1716914095-909560446-1177810406-1002"
```

REG_DWORD     ProfileLoadTimeHigh : (S) 0
REG_DWORD     RefCount         : (S) 1
```

**Observation:** SID `…-1002` maps to a profile named **`sshd_server`** with State value `256` — characteristic of a service account installed by an SSH server. This is corroborated independently by the `netscan` output in Question 4, which shows `sshd.exe` (PID 2016) listening on TCP port 22.

**3.4 Who is SID `…-1000`?**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -K "Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\S-1-5-21-1716914095-909560446-1177810406-1000"
```

REG_DWORD     State            : (S) 0
REG_DWORD     RefCount         : (S) 3
```

**Observation:** SID `…-1000` maps to **`C:\Users\IEUser`** — the same account identified as currently active in Section 3.1. The `RefCount` of 3 (versus 1 for `sshd_server`) indicates multiple active references to the `IEUser` profile at the time of capture.

```

**Observation:** Two user profiles are loaded in memory: `IEUser` (`0x8b5d39b0`) and `sshd_server` (`0xa65269c8`). The presence of the `sshd_server` NTUSER.DAT confirms the SSH service account was active at capture time.

**Figure B2 — `ProfileList` and SID details**

![Figure B2: Volatility printkey ProfileList output showing both user SIDs - the IEUser account SID ending 1000 and the sshd_server service account SID ending 1002.](screenshots/figure_B2_profilelist.png)

*Figure B2: `ProfileList` and both profile SID keys — `IEUser` (`…-1000`) and `sshd_server` (`…-1002`).*

**Interpretation and limitations:**

- The `ProfileList` and `Volatile Environment` keys prove which accounts exist and which is currently active, but **they do not prove that the person at the keyboard was the account owner**. Shared-password, RDP session, or SSH-login scenarios would all produce identical registry evidence with a different human operator.
- The evidence establishes **user-profile activity**, not **human identity**.

**Evidence Log IDs:** E03 (Volatile Environment), E04 (ProfileList), E05 (SID …-1002 / sshd_server), E06 (SID …-1000 / IEUser), E07 (hivelist)

### Question 4: What process and network evidence relates to a potential download or transfer?

**Answer:**

**4.1 Process list — `pslist`**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 pslist
```

**Rows of interest:**

| Offset(V) | Name | PID | PPID | Thds | Hnds | Sess | Wow64 | Start (UTC) |

**Observation:** A `cmd.exe` process with **PID 3996** started at **`2019-01-06 15:06:11 UTC`** — 3 minutes 17 seconds after the USB device was mounted as F:. Its parent is **`explorer.exe` (PID 2524)** — the user launched the command prompt from the desktop shell, not from a scheduled task or script. The paired `conhost.exe` (PID 3988) is the console host created for the new console session.

**Figure B3 — `pslist` showing `cmd.exe` PID 3996 and `conhost.exe` PID 3988**

![Figure B3: Volatility pslist output highlighting the cmd.exe process PID 3996 and its paired conhost.exe process PID 3988, both starting at 15:06:11 UTC.](screenshots/figure_B3_pslist.png)

*Figure B3: `pslist` output highlighting `cmd.exe` PID 3996 and `conhost.exe` PID 3988.*

**4.2 Console host — `pslist -p 3988`**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 pslist -p 3988
```

Confirms PID 3988 = `conhost.exe`, started `2019-01-06 15:06:11 UTC`, session 1 — the console host paired with the `cmd.exe` PID 3996.

**4.3 Network connections — `netscan`**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 netscan
```

**Rows of interest:**

| 0x3e081f50 | UDPv4 | `192.168.56.8:56647` | `*:*` | — | 2388 | `chrome.exe` |

**Observations:**

- The host IP address is **`192.168.56.8`** (confirmed independently by the `ipconfig` output captured in the `consoles` plugin, Question 5).
- **Two closed TCP connections** to **`192.168.56.5:80`** on local ephemeral ports **49177** and **49178**, with PID **-1** (already terminated by the time of capture).
- **`sshd.exe` (PID 2016)** is listening on TCP port 22 (both IPv4 and IPv6) — confirming the SSH server associated with the `sshd_server` profile is active.
- `chrome.exe` (PID 2388) has an open UDP socket at `192.168.56.8:56647` — the browser is running and network-active.

**Interpretation and limitations:**

- A **CLOSED** connection is evidence that a TCP session to `192.168.56.5:80` existed and was torn down. It is **not** evidence of what was transferred. Content inspection would require packet capture, which is out of scope for a memory image.
- **PID -1** indicates the socket outlived its owning process; the string-based attribution provided by YARA scanning could be used to attribute, but is not performed here.

**Figure B4 — `netscan` showing CLOSED connections and the SSH listener**

![Figure B4: Volatility netscan output showing two CLOSED TCP connections from 192.168.56.8 to 192.168.56.5 port 80, and sshd.exe listening on TCP port 22.](screenshots/figure_B4_netscan.png)

*Figure B4: `netscan` — CLOSED connections to `192.168.56.5:80` and the `sshd.exe` listener on port 22.*

**Evidence Log IDs:** E08 (pslist), E09 (netscan)

### Question 5: What does command history show?

**Answer:**

**5.1 Command history — `cmdscan`**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 cmdscan
```

**5.2 Console screen buffer — `consoles`**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 consoles
```

**Excerpt from the console screen buffer of PID 3988:**

C:\Users\IEUser>cd Downloads

C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads>copy secret_file.docx F:
        1 file(s) copied.

C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads>
```

**Observations:**

- The command history is attached to `conhost.exe` **PID 3988** (paired with `cmd.exe` PID 3996, itself a child of `explorer.exe` PID 2524).
- Three commands were recorded in order:
  1. **`ipconfig`** — network diagnostic
  2. **`cd Downloads`** — change directory to the profile's Downloads folder
  3. **`copy secret_file.docx F:`** — copy a file named `secret_file.docx` to drive **F:**
- The **console screen buffer** preserves the shell output verbatim — including the confirmation message **`1 file(s) copied.`** — establishing that the copy operation **completed successfully**.
- The `conhost.exe` process started at **2019-01-06 15:06:11 UTC**, which is **3 minutes 17 seconds after** the USB mounted as F: (15:03:06 UTC) and **1 minute 31 seconds after** the last ShellBag review of Downloads (15:04:40 UTC).

**Interpretation and limitations:**

- The `cmdscan` plugin alone records what was **typed**; the `consoles` plugin records the **screen buffer**, which contains the shell's responses. Together, they establish that `copy secret_file.docx F:` was executed and that the shell reported one file was successfully copied.
- This is stronger evidence than a command string alone. It does **not** prove what the source file contained, nor who typed the command. It **does** establish that a file named `secret_file.docx` existed in `C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads` at that moment and was copied to the F: drive.
- Per the case-study safeguards: "A command string alone may not demonstrate that the copy operation completed." The console output here goes beyond a command string — it records the shell's own success message.

**Figure B5 — `cmdscan` showing the three commands**

![Figure B5: Volatility cmdscan output showing the three commands typed at the console - ipconfig, cd Downloads, and copy secret_file.docx F:.](screenshots/figure_B5_cmdscan.png)

*Figure B5: `cmdscan` output showing the three commands.*

**Figure B6 — `consoles` showing `1 file(s) copied.`**

![Figure B6: Volatility consoles output showing the console screen buffer with the shell transcript, including the confirmation message 1 file(s) copied.](screenshots/figure_B6_consoles.png)

*Figure B6: `consoles` screen buffer — the shell printed **`1 file(s) copied.`***

**Evidence Log IDs:** E10 (cmdscan), E11 (consoles)

### Question 6: What removable-media evidence is present?

**Answer:**

**6.1 USBSTOR enumeration**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -K "ControlSet001\Enum\USBSTOR"
```

```text
Registry: \REGISTRY\MACHINE\SYSTEM
Key name: USBSTOR (S)
Last updated: 2019-01-06 15:02:54 UTC+0000

Subkeys:
  (S) Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00

Values:
```

**Observation:** A USB mass-storage device was enumerated at **`2019-01-06 15:02:54 UTC`**, identified by the device string **`Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00`** — a generic "General UDisk" of revision 5.00, typical of low-cost USB flash drives without a vendor-specific identifier.

**6.2 USBSTOR instance ID**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -K "ControlSet001\Enum\USBSTOR\Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00"
```

```text
Key name: Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00 (S)
Last updated: 2019-01-06 15:02:54 UTC+0000

Subkeys:
  (S) 661bec0f48605_60

Values:
```

**Observation:** The USBSTOR device subkey is **`661bec0f48605_60`**. Per Windows device enumeration conventions, the presence of the underscore structure and no vendor-supplied serial number means Windows generated a system-unique instance ID for this device. This identifier uniquely identifies the device on this workstation.

**6.3 DeviceClasses — disk interface GUID**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -K "ControlSet001\Control\DeviceClasses\{53f56307-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}"
```

```

**Observation:** Five disk-type device interfaces are enumerated. The last row is the USB device, referenced with the **same instance ID** (`661bec0f48605_60`) as the USBSTOR key and a **Last updated** of **`2019-01-06 15:02:54 UTC`**. The device interface class GUID `{53f56307-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}` is the Windows `GUID_DEVINTERFACE_DISK` class — the class of block-storage interfaces (hard drives, USB mass-storage disks).

**6.4 MountedDevices — drive letter ↔ device mapping**

```bash
python2 ~/volatility/vol.py -f working/memdumpWin7_working.mem --profile=Win7SP1x86_23418 printkey -K "MountedDevices"
```

_??_USBSTOR#Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00#661bec0f48605_60#{53f56307-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}
```

**Observation:** The `\DosDevices\F:` value maps **drive letter F:** to the USB device with instance ID **`661bec0f48605_60`** — the same device enumerated in Section 6.1 and 6.2. Additionally, the same device string appears under volume GUID `{421e7e52-11dd-11e9-b3cf-08002709e15d}`, confirming the mapping from both the drive-letter side and the volume-GUID side.

**Interpretation and limitations:**

- The USBSTOR, DeviceClasses, and MountedDevices entries form a **coherent, cross-referenced record** of a USB storage device attached to this workstation and mounted as F:.
- These records **do not prove physical possession** of the device by any named person, nor do they prove the device was written to — only that Windows recognised it and mapped it to F:. The completion of the copy is established separately by the `consoles` output in Question 5.

2       2     Volume Name    E:\
4       0     Volume Name    F:\
```

**Observations:**

- The folder `C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads` was accessed at **2019-01-06 14:49:40 UTC** (the `Mru=1` entry records the first access) and appears again with a **LastWrite** on the parent key of **2019-01-06 15:04:40 UTC**.
- The folder's own **Modified Date** and **Access Date** fields are **14:49:40 UTC** — indicating the earliest access time recorded for the folder in ShellBags.
- The Downloads folder GUID `374de290-123f-4565-9164-39c4925e467b` appears with a separate LastWrite of **14:55:45 UTC** — indicating navigation between the first access and the USB mount.
- The **F:\ volume** entry appears in the volume BagMRU list with a LastWrite of **15:07:03 UTC**.

**Interpretation and limitations:**

- ShellBag times are **folder-view** timestamps. They record when the folder was viewed in File Explorer, not necessarily when a file inside it was modified. Per the case-study safeguards, ShellBag times are folder-view evidence and should not be conflated with file-modification timestamps.
- The Downloads folder was viewed **before** the USB mount (14:49:40 UTC), **during** the folder-GUID navigation (14:55:45 UTC), and **after** the USB mount (15:04:40 UTC). The last review occurs **1 minute 31 seconds before** the `cmd.exe` process is created — consistent with the operator checking the folder contents immediately before issuing the copy command.
- ShellBag **key creation** is a side effect of navigation and cannot prove a file was copied.

### Question 8: What conclusion can you defend?

**Answer:**

**Supported Conclusion:**

The memory image preserves a coherent sequence on **6 January 2019** on workstation `IE8WIN7`:

1. **A user profile named `IEUser`** (SID `S-1-5-21-…-1000`) was logged in and its NTUSER.DAT hive was loaded in memory. Its `Downloads` folder was first accessed in File Explorer at **14:49:40 UTC**.
2. **A generic USB mass-storage device** (`Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00`, instance `661bec0f48605_60`) was **enumerated at 15:02:54 UTC** and **mounted as DOS drive F:** by **15:03:06 UTC**, as recorded in `USBSTOR`, `DeviceClasses`, and `MountedDevices`.
3. **The `Downloads` folder was revisited in File Explorer at 15:04:40 UTC** — between the USB mount and the subsequent command — consistent with checking the folder before acting on it.
4. **A command prompt (`cmd.exe` PID 3996, child of `explorer.exe` PID 2524)** was started at **15:06:11 UTC**, and executed the sequence **`ipconfig`** → **`cd Downloads`** → **`copy secret_file.docx F:`**.
5. **The console screen buffer captured in the memory image shows the shell printed the message `1 file(s) copied.`**, establishing that the copy operation **completed successfully**.

**Confidence Level:**

| Aspect | Confidence | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Artifact authenticity | **High (95%)** | SHA-256 verified working copy; no writes to original |
| Sequence coherence | **High (90%)** | Consistent across USBSTOR, MountedDevices, ShellBags, cmdscan, and consoles |
| Completion of copy operation | **High (90%)** | Console screen buffer prints `1 file(s) copied.` |
| Content of `secret_file.docx` | **Not established** | No file content is preserved in the memory image |
| Personal attribution | **Moderate (60-70%)** | Memory image preserves profile activity, not physical presence |

**Limitations and alternative explanations:**

1. **Browser activity is present but not directly linked.** `chrome.exe` (PID 2388) was running with child processes, and the memory image records a `UDPv4` socket for `chrome.exe` at `192.168.56.8:56647` — but no Chrome download history, cache, or browsing URL was recovered by the plugins run here. A browser-download path to `secret_file.docx` is not established.

2. **Personal attribution is limited.** The `Volatile Environment` key and `ProfileList` identify the profile `IEUser` as active, but do not prove the person physically at the keyboard was the profile's owner. Shared-password scenarios, RDP sessions, or an SSH login using the `sshd_server` profile would produce identical registry evidence with a different operator.

3. **The console output proves the command executed, not that the file was confidential.** The filename `secret_file.docx` is suggestive, but the memory image does not preserve the file's content. Whether the file was truly sensitive would require the source document.

4. **CLOSED network connections are suggestive, not conclusive.** The two CLOSED connections to `192.168.56.5:80` from local ports 49177 and 49178 indicate a TCP session existed and was torn down, but the plugins run here do not identify which process opened them (both show `Pid = -1`). Content of any HTTP exchange is not preserved in a memory image.

5. **Memory images are point-in-time.** The image was captured at **15:09:06 UTC** — 2 minutes 55 seconds after the console command. Any activity occurring earlier in the day that was pruned from the console buffers, or any activity after the capture, is not represented.

6. **The presence of `FTK Imager.exe` (PID 2596)** started at **15:07:15 UTC** — 1 minute 4 seconds after the copy command — is consistent with a forensic acquisition being performed on the workstation, but the memory image itself does not record who launched FTK Imager or why.

7. **The `sshd_server` profile and `sshd.exe` service represent an alternative access vector.** Anyone with credentials to that service account could log into the workstation remotely without going through the physical console. The image does not conclusively rule out activity via SSH.

**Evidence Log ID:** E19

## 5. Timeline

### 5.1 Time Zone Information

| Property | Value |

### 5.3 Timeline Notes

1. **ShellBag times are folder-view timestamps.** Rows 7, 8, 10, and 14 record when the folder was *viewed in File Explorer* — not when any file inside it was modified. Per the case-study safeguards, these are treated as folder-view evidence and are not conflated with file-modification timestamps.

2. **Ordering anomaly in rows 7–10.** The ShellBag access times (`14:49:40`, `14:55:45`, `15:04:40`) appear earlier in wall-clock time than the USB enumeration (`15:02:54`). This is consistent: the operator first opened the Downloads folder at 14:49:40, navigated further at 14:55:45, then — after plugging in the USB at 15:02:54 and mounting it as F: at 15:03:06 — **revisited** the Downloads folder at 15:04:40 to select the target file. The row order reflects logical sequence of events, not strict wall-clock order.

3. **The two CLOSED TCP connections to `192.168.56.5:80`** do not have timestamps recorded in the `netscan` output, so they cannot be placed on the timeline. They are documented in Section 4 Question 4 as an artefact of interest.

4. **Local-time conversion.** The image was captured in the PST time zone (UTC-8). The corresponding local time for the image capture is `2019-01-06 07:09:06 PST`. All other artefact times in this timeline are already recorded by Volatility in UTC and require no conversion.

## 6. Attribution Assessment

### 6.1 Observed Facts vs. Inferences

| Type | Finding | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Observed Fact** | User profile `IEUser` (SID `…-1000`) active; NTUSER.DAT loaded | `printkey "Volatile Environment"`, `hivelist` |
| **Observed Fact** | Second profile `sshd_server` (SID `…-1002`) exists with NTUSER.DAT loaded | `printkey "...\ProfileList"`, `hivelist` |
| **Observed Fact** | USB device `Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00` enumerated at 15:02:54 UTC | `printkey USBSTOR` |
| **Observed Fact** | USB device mapped to drive F: | `printkey MountedDevices` — `\DosDevices\F:` |
| **Observed Fact** | Downloads folder first accessed 14:49:40 UTC, revisited 15:04:40 UTC | ShellBag `BagMRU\0\1\1\0` |
| **Observed Fact** | `cmd.exe` (PID 3996) started at 15:06:11 UTC, parent `explorer.exe` (PID 2524) | `pslist` |
| **Observed Fact** | Commands `ipconfig`, `cd Downloads`, `copy secret_file.docx F:` recorded | `cmdscan` |
| **Observed Fact** | Console screen buffer shows `1 file(s) copied.` | `consoles` |
| **Observed Fact** | Two closed TCP connections to `192.168.56.5:80` from `192.168.56.8` ports 49177, 49178 | `netscan` |
| **Observed Fact** | `sshd.exe` (PID 2016) listening on TCP port 22 | `netscan` |
| **Observed Fact** | `FTK Imager.exe` (PID 2596) started at 15:07:15 UTC | `pslist` |
| **Inference** | The person operating the workstation performed the copy action | Profile-presence assumption; not proof of human identity |
| **Inference** | The USB device was physically present at the workstation | Registry enumeration is strong but not physical proof |
| **Inference** | The file `secret_file.docx` was copied to the USB device | Shell result `1 file(s) copied.` — strong but the file's content is not preserved |
| **Inference** | The 192.168.56.5:80 connections may relate to prior activity | CLOSED state with no owning PID; content unknown |

### 6.2 Confidence Level Matrix

| Attribution Level | Confidence | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Artifact authenticity** | **High (95%)** | SHA-256 verified working copy; documented chain of custody |
| **Sequence coherence** | **High (90%)** | Consistent across `pslist`, `USBSTOR`, `MountedDevices`, `shellbags`, `cmdscan`, `consoles` |
| **Command execution result** | **High (90%)** | Console screen buffer records `1 file(s) copied.` |
| **Content of transferred file** | **Not established** | File content is not preserved in memory |
| **Personal attribution** | **Moderate (60-70%)** | Profile activity ≠ physical presence; multiple access paths exist |

### 6.3 Limitations and Alternative Explanations

| # | Limitation | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Profile presence ≠ human identity** | Shared-password, RDP, or SSH scenarios produce identical registry evidence with a different operator |
| 2 | **Multiple access paths exist** | `sshd.exe` (PID 2016) is listening on port 22 — remote login via SSH is possible without physical access |
| 3 | **File content not preserved** | The memory image records the filename and copy result, not the file's content |
| 4 | **CLOSED network sockets with no owning PID** | Attribution to a specific process requires additional YARA scanning, not performed here |
| 5 | **ShellBag times are folder-view evidence** | Cannot be conflated with file-modification times |
| 6 | **Point-in-time capture** | The image captures 15:09:06 UTC; activity before or after is not represented |
| 7 | **FTK Imager started 1 minute 4 seconds after the copy** | Consistent with a forensic acquisition, but the memory image does not establish who launched it |
| 8 | **No browser download history recovered** | Chrome was running but no download history was extracted by the plugins used; the origin of `secret_file.docx` is not established |

### 6.4 MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Technique | ID | Relevance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data from Local System** | T1005 | Local folder `C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads` accessed and file copied |
| **Exfiltration Over Physical Medium** | T1052.001 | USB mass-storage device used as transfer medium |
| **Command and Scripting Interpreter: Windows Command Shell** | T1059.003 | `cmd.exe` used to execute `copy` |
| **Remote Services: SSH** | T1021.004 | `sshd.exe` listening — potential alternative access |
| **File and Directory Discovery** | T1083 | ShellBag evidence of Downloads folder navigation |

## 9. Conclusion

This forensic investigation reconstructed a coherent, evidence-based sequence from a Windows 7 x86 memory image captured on **6 January 2019 at 15:09:06 UTC** from workstation **`IE8WIN7`**. The evidence establishes with **high confidence** that:

1. **A USB mass-storage device** (`Disk&Ven_General&Prod_UDisk&Rev_5.00`, instance `661bec0f48605_60`) was enumerated at **15:02:54 UTC** and mounted as DOS drive **F:** — as recorded in the `USBSTOR`, `DeviceClasses`, and `MountedDevices` registry keys.
2. **The `Downloads` folder** of the active user profile `IEUser` (`C:\Users\IEUser\Downloads`) was viewed in File Explorer at **14:49:40 UTC** and revisited at **15:04:40 UTC** — between the USB mount and the subsequent command.
3. **A command prompt** (`cmd.exe` PID 3996, spawned from `explorer.exe` PID 2524 and hosted by `conhost.exe` PID 3988) was started at **15:06:11 UTC** and executed the sequence **`ipconfig` → `cd Downloads` → `copy secret_file.docx F:`**.
4. **The console screen buffer** preserved in the memory image records the shell output **`1 file(s) copied.`**, confirming the copy operation **completed**.

**Personal attribution remains moderate.** The memory image preserves profile activity, not physical presence. The presence of an `sshd.exe` service listening on TCP port 22 and an SSH service-account profile (`sshd_server`) means that remote access via SSH is a plausible alternative vector for the activity, independent of the person physically at the keyboard.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Memory forensics recovers executable evidence that disk forensics may not.** The command-history strings and — critically — the **console screen buffer** would not be available from a disk-only examination of a powered-off workstation.
2. **Cross-plugin corroboration is essential.** No single plugin establishes the sequence; only the alignment of `pslist`, `netscan`, `cmdscan`, `consoles`, `printkey`, and `shellbags` produces a defensible account.
3. **Registry artefacts carry device-attachment evidence.** `USBSTOR`, `DeviceClasses`, and `MountedDevices` together uniquely identify a USB device and its drive-letter assignment.
4. **ShellBag timestamps are folder-view evidence, not file-modification timestamps.** They help place user navigation on the timeline but should not be over-interpreted.
5. **A command string and a console result are different classes of evidence.** The `cmdscan` string proves the command was typed; the `consoles` screen buffer proves the shell reported it succeeded.
6. **Even the strongest technical evidence does not identify a person.** Attribution requires correlation with authentication logs, physical-access records, or other context external to the memory image.
